        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <p>Below are my evaluations of one well-designed website and one poorly-designed website, analyzed using the CRAP principles: Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity.</p>

        <!-- Good Website Evaluation -->
        <section class="good-site-evaluation">
            <h3><a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Arts & Culture</a></h3>
            <p>
                This site is a massive, highly curated online exhibition featuring high-resolution collections from museums worldwide. It focuses on rich media, storytelling, and an intuitive user experience. It serves as an excellent example of modern, clean, and accessible web design.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contrast (C):</strong> Excellent. The design relies heavily on stark white space and high-quality imagery, ensuring text is always legible against its background. Clear typographic hierarchy uses differences in font weight and size to make titles stand out from body text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition (R):</strong> Strong consistency is maintained through the use of standardized card layouts, uniform iconography, and a limited, predictable color palette. This repetition creates a unified experience across thousands of different exhibits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment (A):</strong> Impeccable use of a clean grid system. Text, images, and navigational elements are perfectly aligned vertically and horizontally, contributing to a professional, orderly, and sophisticated appearance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proximity (P):</strong> Effective grouping is evident in the card structure, where the image, title, and institutional attribution are grouped tightly to form a single, related unit. Generous spacing between these groups prevents clutter and improves scannability.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Bad Website Evaluation -->
        <section class="bad-site-evaluation">
            <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/" target="_blank">LingsCars.com</a></h3>
            <p>
                This UK car leasing website is famous for its deliberately overwhelming, chaotic design. It features clashing colors, blinking text, numerous animated GIFs, and a complete lack of visual hierarchy, making it notoriously difficult to navigate and read.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contrast (C):</strong> Poor. The site suffers from excessive use of clashing, vibrant colors (e.g., neon yellow text on bright pink backgrounds, bright red on blue) and too many animated elements, which destroys any sense of visual hierarchy and makes the content hard on the eyes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition (R):</strong> While certain distracting elements like animated GIFs are repeated, the overall lack of consistent structural repetition or stylistic unity makes the entire page feel fragmented, confusing, and visually exhausting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment (A):</strong> Non-existent. Text blocks, animated images, and links are scattered seemingly at random without any organizing grid or consistent alignment. This haphazard placement creates a crowded, unprofessional, and frantic environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proximity (P):</strong> Poor. Unrelated blocks of content, various promotional banners, and navigation links are crammed closely together without adequate whitespace, making it nearly impossible for a user to determine which pieces of information belong to a single group.
                </li>
            </ul>
